# jdbc-learning-hub
jdbc-learning-hub is a dedicated space within my Java Full Stack Journey  focused on mastering  JDBC. This covers how Java interacts with relational databases like MySQL( CRUD operations, SQL integration, and real-world mini projects.)  It bridges the gap between Core Java and Backend Development &amp; foundation for Spring &amp;  Springboot  technology.
